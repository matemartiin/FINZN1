# API Key Security Implementation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT SECURITY LIMITATIONS

The current implementation has **CRITICAL SECURITY LIMITATIONS** that need to be addressed before production deployment:

### üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE: Client-Side API Key Exposure

**Problem**: Gemini API keys are currently embedded in the client-side JavaScript bundle, making them visible to anyone who inspects the code.

**Risk Level**: HIGH - API keys can be extracted and used maliciously, leading to:
- Unauthorized API usage
- Unexpected costs
- Potential service abuse
- Security breaches

## üõ°Ô∏è CURRENT MITIGATION MEASURES

We have implemented the following **temporary security measures**:

### 1. Domain Validation
- API calls are restricted to authorized domains only
- Unauthorized domains will fallback to mock responses
- Authorized domains: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `finzn.netlify.app`

### 2. Secure Access Layer
- Centralized API key access through `getSecureApiKey()` method
- Domain validation through `isAuthorizedDomain()` method
- Clear warnings in code about security limitations

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- Applications falls back to mock responses when:
  - No API key is available
  - Domain is not authorized
  - API calls fail

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Server-Side Proxy (RECOMMENDED)

Create a backend API that:
```
Client ‚Üí Your API Server ‚Üí Gemini API
```

**Benefits**:
- API keys never exposed to client
- Complete control over usage
- Can implement rate limiting
- Can add additional security layers

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Replace in client code:
const response = await fetch('/api/ai-chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message, userId })
});
```

### Option 2: API Key Restrictions in Google Cloud Console

1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to "Credentials"
3. Edit your API key
4. Add application restrictions:
   - **HTTP referrers**: `https://finzn.netlify.app/*`
   - **API restrictions**: Only allow Gemini API

**Benefits**:
- Limits usage to specific domains
- API key still visible but less dangerous

### Option 3: Environment-Based Deployment

Use different API keys for different environments:
- Development: Restricted test key
- Production: Server-side proxy only

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Immediate Actions (Current Implementation)
- [x] Centralized API key access
- [x] Domain validation
- [x] Graceful fallback mechanisms
- [x] Security warnings in code
- [x] Removed API key logging

### Short-term Actions (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Restrict API key in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Implement rate limiting in client
- [ ] Add API usage monitoring
- [ ] Create server-side proxy endpoint

### Long-term Actions (Production Ready)
- [ ] Full server-side API implementation
- [ ] Authentication for API access
- [ ] Usage quotas per user
- [ ] Comprehensive API security audit

## üîß HOW TO CONFIGURE API KEY RESTRICTIONS

### In Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
3. Find your Gemini API key
4. Click "Edit"
5. Under "Application restrictions":
   - Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
   - Add: `https://finzn.netlify.app/*`
   - Add: `http://localhost:*` (for development)
6. Under "API restrictions":
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Choose only the Gemini/AI APIs you're using
7. Save changes

### In Netlify Environment Variables:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Site Settings ‚Üí Environment variables
3. Ensure `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
4. Consider creating separate keys for different environments

## üö® SECURITY WARNINGS

1. **Never commit API keys to repositories**
2. **Always use environment variables**
3. **Rotate API keys regularly**
4. **Monitor API usage for anomalies**
5. **Implement proper error handling**

## üìä MONITORING API USAGE

Monitor your API usage in Google Cloud Console:
- Set up billing alerts
- Monitor quotas and limits
- Review usage patterns
- Set up anomaly detection
